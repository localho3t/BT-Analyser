## Connect to database

The database used in this software is MySQL. Firstly, you need to create a user in MySQL and then provide the details such as [host, username , password , DB Name] when running the software. Additionally, two other parameters are required in the configuration files which are the log directory address and the repetition rate within a time interval. After entering the information, the program automatically creates the database and its tables and starts working. If you encounter an error, edit the created .env file.
